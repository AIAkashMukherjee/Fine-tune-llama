# Sentiment Classification Fine-Tuned Model

This project involves fine-tuning the LLaMA-2 7B Chat model on the Stanford Sentiment Dataset to perform sentiment classification. The model is trained to classify input text into sentiment categories such as positive, neutral, and negative.

## Overview

The fine-tuned model is based on the `NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` pre-trained checkpoint. The Stanford Sentiment Dataset provides labeled examples for training. Using supervised fine-tuning techniques along with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, the model learns to predict the sentiment of sentences accurately.

## Features

* Uses a large language model (LLaMA-2 7B) adapted for sentiment classification
* Supports three sentiment classes: positive, neutral, and negative
* Trained using efficient training strategies to optimize compute and memory usage
* Suitable for deployment on CPU or GPU with optional model offloading
* Provides inference capability to classify new sentences with high accuracy
